                <p>
                  Except as stated in these Terms, they are governed by
                  Singapore laws. For cross-jurisdictional orders (e.g.,
                  Philippines users placing Singapore orders), Trucklah reserves
                  the right to determine applicable terms. Any disputes shall be
                  settled by mediation, arbitration, or Singapore courts as
                  Trucklah deems appropriate.
